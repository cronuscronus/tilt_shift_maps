This mash-up uses the Pixastic library, the Bing maps API, and jQuery to create a tilt shift blur when viewing images in birds-eye mode.

In order to use this system, you will need to obtain a Bing maps API key here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx and set the value in index.html to "maps_key".

Thanks to Pixastic (http://www.pixastic.com/) for writing an awesome image processing library in JavaScript, and to Bing for loading their tiles as actual JPEG's so they're easy to fetch!
